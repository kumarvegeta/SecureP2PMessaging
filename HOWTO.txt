To install (ON UNIX / LINUX based systems only):

1. Just extract all files into current working directory, and run make in that directory.
2. DO not attempt to modify any files. Just set execute permission on peer1_script and peer2_script if not already present.

To run:

just run the following in your present working directory (in two separate terminal windows):

./peer1_script (in one of the windows)

./peer2_script (in another terminal window)

Thank you for taking the time to install and run my project. Hope you like it. Enjoy !
